# Api

## The Goal

The purpose of this project is to create an API that allows us to manage users and events with CRUD operations.
CRUD stands for the four basic actions for managing data in an application:

Create: Add a new user or event.
Read: Retrieve information about a user or event.
Update: Modify the details of an existing user or event.
Delete: Remove a user or event.
So, CRUD refers to the actions of managing data, not specific events themselves.

## How to Use
